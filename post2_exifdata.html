        <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p>
            For no particular reason, I decided to get into photography in the fall of 2022. Since then, I've taken over 20,000
            pictures and videos across nearly 3 years. Recently, I realized that I could access the EXIF data (metadata
            created by the camera when each picture or video is taken) and use my Data Science experience to see what
            I could learn from it.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a Canon camera enthusiast, I use Canon's lenses with my EOS R8, which uses the Canon RF lens mount. A top
            lens I used throughout the past several years was the the RF 24-105 F4L. This lens has great sharpness,
            and allowed me to get both wide-angled and zoomed-in pictures in a wide variety of circumstances. In Semptember
            of 2024, the RF 28-70 F2.8 was released by Canon. This lens, although it had a smalller zoom range, is able to
            perform better in low-light situations, as well as give more subject separation, which means the background blurs
            out more, isolating the subject. Both of these are desireable aspects of photography.
            </p>
            <p>
            Because I found myself shooting video in low-light situations, and also wanted to transition more into 
            portrait photography, (and as a budget-limited college student,) trading out the RF 24-105 F4 for the
            RF 28-70 F2.8 seemed like an appealing idea. I would get 1 stop more of light (f4 â†’ f2.8) at the cost of
            the 24mm - 27mm and 71mm - 105mm ranges. I realized this data could help me answer this question:
            </p>
            <p><i><b>Was it in my best interest to trade out my 24-105 f4L for the 28-70 2.8?</b></i></p>
            <p>
            After my analysis, I sold my 24-105 and purchased a 28-70. I found that the trade off wasn't worth it,
            but not for the reasons I initially thought. Let's take a look at the data. I'll show you my reasoning,
            explain my situation, and walk you through my experience with the lenses.
            </p>
        <h2> Extraction</h2>
        <p> Data was extracted using a powershell script that would call Exiftool, a free tool for extracting image
        metadata. I initially tried using the tool to extract the exif data without a powershell script, but the script
        would stall randomly. It seemed to be doing this because it would hit a memory cap for parsing the exif data, so
        I used a powershell to run Exiftool on each subdirectory, then write the results to a csv before moving on.
        The workaround was successful. Here's the powershell script:</p>

        # Output CSV path
        $output = "D:\Documents\_Misc\exif_metadata.csv"
        $first = $true

        # Get all subdirectories recursively
        Get-ChildItem -Path "D:\Photography\_CAMERA SORTED" -Directory -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
            $dir = $_.FullName

            # Count matching files in this folder only
            $filesInDir = Get-ChildItem -Path $dir -Include *.jpg,*.jpeg -File
            $count = $filesInDir.Count

            Write-Host "`n---"
            Write-Host "Folder: $dir"
            Write-Host "Found $count JPG/JPEG files"

            if ($count -eq 0) { return }

            if ($first) {
                # First folder: include header
                exiftool -csv -common -Lens "$dir" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 -FilePath $output
                $first = $false
            } else {
                # Skip header from additional folders
                exiftool -csv -common -Lens "$dir" | Select-Object -Skip 1 | Out-File -Encoding utf8 -FilePath $output -Append
            }
        }
        </script></code></pre>
        
        
        
        <p>With data extracted, I was ready to investigate.</p>
        
        <h2> Wrangling</h2>
        
        <p>I decided to use R for this project. There were several goals with wrangling the data:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Isolate the shots to just my R8. I had previously shot with the m50 ii, so those files were intermixed.</li>
            <li>Clean up information problems related to manual lenses. Manual lenses are vintage lenses that don't have
            electronics to communicate to the camera. This can introduce non-numeric or unexpected inputs where there
            otherwise wouldn't be any.</li>
            <li>Standardize certain parameters like file size to just be MB instead of kb and MB.</li>
            <li>Remove 'garbage' shots, for example, pictures with ISO past 25600, which would only be taken for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Reformat alphanumeric fields to just numeric to make them easier to work with.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p> Here's the R code for that:</p>

        <p>This next piece of code filters out large file sizes and videos. It's helpful for one chart which we will
        see shortly, but otherwise I didn't run it for the output of the other graphs that you'll see.
        </p>
        <p>Initially, I filtered out videos and large files using this next chunk, but in hindsight I'm not really sure
        why I did this- I wanted to focus on video as much if not more than photo, so filtering out videos could have potentially
        skewed my findings. Comparing video + picture to picture only, my findings in all charts looked nearly identical.
        So, in the long run it didn't make a difference but it had the potential to.</p>

        <h2> What the Data Doesn't Tell You</h2>
            <p>There were several assumptions I had made when choosing the 28-70.
            I had assumed that the lens would be the same sharpness. In my testing, it seemed it wasn't as sharp. Various
            tests online showed that the 28-70 2.8 had inconsistencies in manufacturing quality that made some lenses
            less sharp than others. Although I didn't have access to high quality tools for testing, or other lenses
            for comparison, I had a gut feeling that the len wasn't as sharp as it could be, or as online tests had shown.
            </p>
            <p>
            Size, zoom range problems. 2.8 not that big of a difference.
            Bokeh quality more important than separation, and 2.8 was 'busy.' Which meant both 'lively' and 'distracting'.
            I took out bigger file sizes to just focus on pictures and videos, but the 24-105 was what I had used primarily
            for videos, so it skewed my analysis.
