      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by cinematic movies and media, I decided to get into photography and videography in the fall of 2022.
        Since then, I've taken over 12,000 pictures and videos. Recently, I realized that I could access the EXIF data
        (metadata created by the camera when each picture or video is taken) and use my data science experience to see
        what I could learn from it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I initially started photography with Canon cameras and lenses, and have used the Canon EOS R8, which uses
        Canon's native RF lens mount. My most used lens throughout the past several years was the the
        <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/rf24-105mm-f4-l-is-usm" target="_blank"
          ><span class="open_in_new_tab_icon"></span>RF 24-105 F4 L IS USM.</a
        >
        This lens has great sharpness and allowed me to get both wide-angled and zoomed-in pictures in a wide variety of
        circumstances. In September of 2024, Canon released the
        <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/rf28-70mm-f2-8-is-stm" target="_blank"
          ><span class="open_in_new_tab_icon"></span>RF 28-70 IS STM.</a
        >
        This lens, although it had a smalller zoom range compared to the 24-105 f4L, has a slightly wider max aperture.
        A wider maximum aperature means a shallower depth of field, which means that the background and foreground of a picture 
        'blur' out more which creates more subject separation and a more pleasing background with beautiful bokeh (pleasing
        circle shapes). THe 28 - 70 also is smaller and lighter. All of these lens characteristics are desireable as a photographer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because I found myself shooting video in low-light situations, and also wanted to transition more into portrait
        photography, trading out the RF 24-105 F4 for the RF 28-70 F2.8 seemed like an appealing idea. I would get an
        additional stop of light (f4 → f2.8) at the cost of the 24mm - 27mm and 71mm - 105mm ranges. Naturally I would
        like to keep both lenses, but as a budget-limited college student, I couldn't afford to keep both. I realized
        data from my photography could help me answer this question:
      </p>

      <p>
        <i><b>Was it in my best interest to trade out my 24-105 f4L for the 28-70 2.8?</b></i>
      </p>

      <p>
        I analyzed data from the EXIF information embedded in my pictures and videos. After my analysis, I sold my
        24-105 and purchased a 28-70, but after finding that the trade off wasn't worth it, I returned the 28-70 for
        another 24-105 f4L. The reasons I wasn't happy with the 28-70, however, were based on factors the data didn't
        show. Let's take a look at the data. I'll show you my reasoning, explain my situation, and walk you through my
        experience with the lenses.
      </p>

      <h2>Conditions for the Trade</h2>
      <p>
        Before wrangling the data, there were some expectations for what conditions would warrant selling the lens. Here
        are some of those conditions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If there were significantly fewer pictures and videos at the 24-27 and 70-105 focal lengths than the focal
          lengths the new lens could cover.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there were a lot of pictures and videos around slower shutter speeds (~30-120fps) and higher ISOs (4500+).
          This would indicate that an extra stop of light could have made the difference in the situation between usable
          and unusable footage.
        </li>
        <li>If I would prefer the smaller and lighter form factor of the newer lens.</li>
        <li>If the image quality and background rendering of the new lens were similar or better than the F4L.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the analysis, we will figure out of which of these conditions are met.</p>

      <h2>Extraction</h2>

      <p>
        EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File Format. Nearly all modern cameras automatically embed this data into
        each image and video it takes. From my pictures and videos taken from the past several years, I extracted the
        EXIF data using a powershell script that would call
        <a href="https://exiftool.org/" target="_blank">Exiftool</a>, a free tool for extracting image metadata. I
        initially tried using the tool to extract the exif data without a powershell script, but the script would stall
        randomly. It seemed to be doing this because it would hit a memory cap for parsing the exif data, so I used a
        powershell to run Exiftool on each subdirectory, then write the results to a csv before moving on. The
        workaround was successful. Here's the powershell script:
      </p>

      <pre
        class="code"
        data-lang="PS1"><button class="code-toggle" aria-label="Toggle code">test</button><button class="copy-button" aria-label="Copy to clipboard">📋</button><code class="block"><script type="text/plain">
        # Output CSV path
        $output = "D:\Documents\_Misc\exif_metadata.csv"
        $first = $true

        # Get all subdirectories recursively
        Get-ChildItem -Path "D:\Photography\_CAMERA SORTED" -Directory -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
            $dir = $_.FullName

            # Count matching files in this folder only
            $filesInDir = Get-ChildItem -Path $dir -Include *.jpg,*.jpeg -File
            $count = $filesInDir.Count

            Write-Host "`n---"
            Write-Host "Folder: $dir"
            Write-Host "Found $count JPG/JPEG files"

            if ($count -eq 0) { return }

            if ($first) {
                # First folder: include header
                exiftool -csv -common -Lens "$dir" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 -FilePath $output
                $first = $false
            } else {
                # Skip header from additional folders
                exiftool -csv -common -Lens "$dir" | Select-Object -Skip 1 | Out-File -Encoding utf8 -FilePath $output -Append
            }
        }
        </script></code></pre>

      <p>With data extracted, I was ready to investigate.</p>

      <h2>Wrangling</h2>

      <p>I decided to use R for this project. There were several goals with wrangling the data:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Isolate the shots to just my R8. I had previously shot with the m50 ii, so those files were intermixed.</li>
        <li>
          Clean up information problems related to manual lenses. Manual lenses are vintage lenses that don't have
          electronics to communicate to the camera. This can introduce non-numeric or unexpected inputs where there
          otherwise wouldn't be any.
        </li>
        <li>Standardize certain parameters like file size to just be MB instead of kb and MB.</li>
        <li>
          Remove 'garbage' shots, for example, pictures with ISO past 25600, which would only be taken for testing
          purposes.
        </li>
        <li>Reformat alphanumeric fields to just numeric to make them easier to work with.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Here's the R code for that:</p>

        This next piece of code filters out large file sizes and videos. It's helpful for one chart which we will see
        shortly, but otherwise I didn't run it for the output of the other graphs that you'll see.

        <p>We can see in both graphs that the 24-105 was my most used lens, by far in comparison to the others.
        We see the 85 as a runner up, and 'Unspecified Manual Lens' Which refers to adapted vintage lenses that
        are entirely mechanical, so don't produce any data like the RF lenses. </p>
        <p>Lenses aside from the 24-105 mostly fall into the 35-85 range, which the 28-70 could nearly cover.
        So, we need to see what focal lengths I preferred with the 24-105 to see if switching would still allow us
        to cover our most used focal lengths.</p>

        <h3>Focal Lengths</h3>
        <br>
        Let's take a look at two charts that show us which focal lengths I used.

          <iframe title="Focal Length Binned" src="post2-assets/Focal_Length_Binned.html" class="plot-frame"></iframe>
          <iframe title="Focal Length Binned" src="post2-assets/Focal_Length_24_105.html" class="plot-frame"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p> These graphs have count on the X axis where it would normally be on the Y axis because we are seeing the focal length
          ranges, and they wouldn't look so good on the X axis. With that out of the way:
        </p>
        <p> We can see distinct spikes from the previous lenses in the combined graph, and we can also see that with the 24-105,
        a large portion of shots are at the extremes- 24 and 105, with the rest forming a left skewed bell curve.
        Understanding photography shows that this actually just a normal bell curve- the skew occurs because as focal lengths increase,
        the difference in field of view decreases relative. In other words, the difference between 24 and 25mm in field
        of view is more pronounced than 85 to 86, and so on. We could also understand the big spikes at the ends to be in situations
        where I probably would have preferred a higher or lower focal length to take the picture, but had to take the limit that the lens
        could go to. Overall I think this shows that the lens is getting great value from it's zoom capability. </p>
        <p> My RF 85mm f2 has a big spike in the graph, and I assumed that this would be sufficient if I wanted a lens in the 
        70-100 range, and my vintage <a href="https://www.pentaxforums.com/lensreviews/Super-Multi-Coated-TAKUMAR-Super-Takumar-135mm-F2.5.html" target="_blank"><span class="open_in_new_tab_icon"></span>SMC Pentax Takumar 135mm F2.5</a>
        could cover higher focal ranges.</p>
        <p> In hindsight, the value wasn't just covering ranges- it was not having to change lenses in between taking shots- 
        ideal for situations like travel, or important events. </p>

        <h3>Aperture</h3>
        
        <p>Let's take a look at aperture for the 24-105 and for all lenses.</p>

        <p>Apertures were binned to fit roughly standard apertures. 
          We see a large spike at f4, in the first chart with all lenses, and then about 3000 total pictures
        taken at apertures below f4. Of course I would probably have liked to take a lot of those pictures on the
        24-105 at below f4, but couldn't because of the aperture limit. However there are a lot of pictures taken at
        f5.6 and above on the 24-105, in fact more than half, meaning it wasn't happening all the time. For most
        situations, f4 produces a sufficient enough background blur and isn't a dealbreaker.</p>
        <p> While 2.8 would be nice to have, it would seem we need to take a look at ISOs and Shutter speeds to see if we
        ended up in situations often where a little extra light could have given us a usable image where it otherwise would have been
        unusable.</p>

        <h3>Number of Pictures by ISO and Shutter Speed</h3>
        <p> ISO is setting that increases signal, but adds noise. It's helpful for low light situations.
        Increasing aperture adds light, as well as slowing down shutter speed, but shutter speed, ISO, and aperture
        each modify different elements and work in tandem to manage light and deliver the image the photographer wants.
        </p>
         <iframe title="Aperture" src="post2-assets/Num_Pictures_ISO_and_Shutter%20Speed.html" class="plot-frame"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>Yellow indicates a lot of pictures taken, where empty squares or blue squares indicates very few or no pictures
      taken. We see a large amount of pictures and videos taken around ISO 100 and Shutter Speed of 1/250, and another
      small spike around ISO 6400 and shutter speed of 1/250.</p>
      <p> What this shows is that a marginal increase in light could have helped us perhaps get a more usable image in the 
      ISO 6400 situations where we probably didn't want to compromise shutter speed, but overall it's not a significant
      enough proportion for it to make a difference.</p>
      
      <h2>Analysis Conclusions</h2>
      <p>From the analysis, it could go either way- If getting a slightly larger aperture than f4 would make a slightly more
      pleasing bokeh and more background blur, and a lighter lens was really important to me, I think it could be justified.
      I also had other lenses that could have taken care of the focal lengths that I would be giving up by trading, namely
      the 71-105 range. I was ok with those prospects and thought that overall it would be a good idea to make the trade.</p>
      <h2>What Happened?</h2>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        There were several assumptions I had made when choosing the 28-70. I had assumed that the lens would be the same
        sharpness as both advertised, and the F4L. In my testing, it seemed it wasn't as sharp. Various online tests
        done by other photographers showed that the 28-70 2.8 had inconsistencies in manufacturing quality that made
        some lenses less sharp than others. Although I didn't have access to high quality tools for testing, or other
        lenses for comparison, I had a gut feeling that the len wasn't as sharp as it could be, or as online tests had
        shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside that, was the background rendering. To me, the 28-70 had a very 'busy' background blur that to me was
        distracting and unpleasant. While I did like the form factor change, the loss in lens quality and undesirable
        rendering to me was a deal breaker. <b> The extra stop of light was not worth the tradeoffs in my opinion.</b> I
        had expected
      </p>

      <p>
        Size, zoom range problems. 2.8 not that big of a difference. Bokeh quality more important than separation, and
        2.8 was 'busy.' Which meant both 'lively' and 'distracting'. I took out bigger file sizes to just focus on
        pictures and videos, but the 24-105 was what I had used primarily for videos, so it skewed my analysis.
